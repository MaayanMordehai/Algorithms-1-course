## First Assignment
1. Implement prim mst algorithm without using outside sources for graphs/trees.
2. Implement a function that will change mst if needed because of adding an edge.
3. Write main that will create graph with at least 20 verticals and at least 50 edges and print it.
   - create mst from your graph and print it.
   - add an edge that will not change the mst and print the mst.
   - add an edge that will change the mst and print the new mst.

## Second Assignment
Solve Box Stacking problem and print the tower in O(n^2)
